# House Points Slackbot

This amazing bot will let everyone on your slack team award points to different House. Our code of honor is

  - No awarding points to your own house
  - Cheating will be punished with great wrath and greater whimsy
 
To set it up, just insert your slack API token, the channel you'd like to listen on, pip install the requirements, and run `python main.py` on some server somewhere. Hackathon style!
